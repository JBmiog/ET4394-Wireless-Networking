\chapter{Background}

The transceiver module that is being used has been build by the author in order to fulfill the degree of bachelor of applied sciences in 2013. The transceiver module is designed at, and currently produced by, T-Minus engineering B.V. It contains two chips, an Atmega Arduino compatible micro controller and a transceiver chip, the Murata TRC105. The module can be connected to a computer via USB, after which a Arduino sketch can be uploaded.

At the moment, this transceiver is used by ESA during the CanSat competition, in which multiple high-school teams create mini satellites the size of a soda can. The mini satellites are launched in a rocket, up to a height of 1,5 kilometer. Then, the satellites are decoupled and should open a parachute to safely land. During descending, measurements are being done by the satellite. In order to simulate a space mission as good as possible, the data of the measurements is to be wireless transmitted during the 'mission'.

While the teams on the ground aim Yagi antenna's on their CanSat's to receive the signal, every once in a while, they don't succeed in receiving anything, while the CanSat is thought to be transmitting. 

The goal of this project is to build a receiver which can listen to the channels of each team simultaneously. After receiving, the data has to be decoded. In order to receive in such a wide spectrum, an SDR will be used.
