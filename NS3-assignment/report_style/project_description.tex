\section{Objective} 

In this simulation, results are obtained to formulate an answer to the following question; 

	what happens if an encreasing amount of AP fail in a network with respect to
	- the average througput per node
	- regarding which data rate's? 
	- constant
	- regarding which packet size
	
What happens to the average throughput of stations in a 802.11b network when an increasing number of Acces Points (AP's) fail, with
respect to the different data rates and different packet sizes?

During simulation, the amount of nodes stays constantly 30, while the number of AP's decreases. The failure of an AP is mimicked by 
redoing the simulation with an altered distribution of stations, with one or more AP less. 

\section{Hypothesis}
As the number of nodes per AP will increase, the average throughput of all nodes is expected to decrease. Because now, the CSMA/CA machanism backs off more often,
having larger contention windows, which will further decrease the throughput.
