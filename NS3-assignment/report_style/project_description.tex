\section{objective} 

In this simulation, results are obtained to formulate an answer to the following question; 
What happens to the average throughput of stations in a 802.11b network when an increasing number of Acces Points (AP's) fail? 
During simulation, the amount of nodes stays constant, while the number of AP's decreases. The failure of an AP is mimicked by 
redoing the simulation with an altered distribution of stations, with one AP less. 

\section{Hypothesis}
As the number of nodes per AP will increase, the average throughput of all nodes is expected to decrease as well.
