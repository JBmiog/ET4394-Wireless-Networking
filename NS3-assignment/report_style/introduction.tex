\section{Assignment description} 

This assignment is one of two assignments given in the course of Wireless Networks [4393] at the Technical University of Delft. The assignment consist of writing a simulation in C++, using the NS-3 Network simulator, in order to simulate IEEE802.11b properties with respect to changing network properties. 

\section{The NS-3 network simulator} 
NS-3 is a discreet-event network simulator, which is free for download at \url{https://www.nsnam.org/}. It contains models for Wi-Fi and Wi-Max, among others. The software is licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license. Although simulation files are  originally written in c++, recent features also support python scripts. The simulator supports WiFi simulation up to layer 3. During this project, version ns-3.24.1 is used.

\section{802.11b specification} 
802.11b operates in the 2.4 GHz band and is capable of transferring data with rates up to 11Mbps, if this does not succeed, it can change to data rates of 5.5Mbps, 2Mbps, or 1 Mbps. 802.11b uses the CSMA/CA technique to let nodes communicate. It is Complementary Code Keyed (CCK) modulated, which is based on Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum modulation (DSSS) \cite{802_11_b}.
