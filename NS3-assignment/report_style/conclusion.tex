\chapter{Conclusion} 

From the results obtained by the simulations, we can draw the conclusion that 802.11b, using IPv4 packets, throughput decrease when more stations join the same access points. This is simulated with a variety of stations per access point, three different packet sizes, four different data rates and 30 stations in total sending packets to one node in the network.
